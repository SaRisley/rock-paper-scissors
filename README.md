This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors react web app which was used to experiment with React and sharing state/props amongst components. 

This was also used to experiement with creating an exciting, engaging frontend and UI. 

This project also allowed me to experiement with deploying an app via AWS and was sucessfully deployed via AWS Amplify: https://main.d1vu96kenrpefg.amplifyapp.com/
